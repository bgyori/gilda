Terms of Service
================

These terms of service refer to the Gilda Google Docs add-on.

By using the term "add-on" we mean a service which provides additional
functionality to G Suite services. You can enable or disable the Gilda add-on
at any time via the G Suite Marketplace.

- The add-on extends functionality of G Suite services and is provided as an
  installable component from the G Suite Marketplace.
- To use the add-on, you need a Google account.

We are constantly improving the add-on. We may add or remove features.

All services by the add-on are provided "as is", without warranty of any
kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no
event shall the Gilda project, The President and Fellows of Harvard College,
any and all employees of The President and Fellows of Harvard College or
contributors to the Gilda project be liable for any claim, damages or other
liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from,
out of or in connection with any software or any services or the use or other
dealings in any software or any services. This disclaimer of liability includes
but is not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or
consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute
goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption)
however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict
liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out
of the use of software or services provided by the Gilda project, even if
advised of the possibility of such damage.
