Privacy policy
==============

This document refers to the Gilda Google Docs add-on and explains what information we collect and how we use that information.

The Gilda add-on makes requests to the public Gilda web service at http://grounding.indra.bio. The request payload contains the specific span of text being grounded. The web service logs requests capturing the text being grounded and the service's response. This data is used to aggregate anonymous usage statistics and to improve the service. The add-on and the web service do not collect any user information.

We will post any privacy policy changes on this page.
